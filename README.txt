cockpit-syncwatch v0.8.0

cockpit-syncwatch -- cockpit UI for SyncWatch
================= == ======= == === =========

This plugin not heavily documented yet, but that is probably not nessessary. It's a cockit UI to use and
configure SyncWatch from a web UI.

It uses cockpit-stdplgin as standard look and feel for this UI.

Watches can be added/ deleted and all available syncwatch settings can be configured from this plugin.

That's all for now ...
